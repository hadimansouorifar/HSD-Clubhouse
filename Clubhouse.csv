I've had my concept of the idea of indigenous city to land refined primarily by guy,0
 I always thought the idea of the promised land and the prom and the prayer to Jerusalem,0
 And next next year in Jerusalem was something spiritual and of faith,0
" But I have another layer added to my understanding of that, which is that there's a sense that the people were there, they see it as sort of a displacement and then to tha or however thousands of years later they go back",0
 So there's another layer added to my knowledge mine as well,0
" Yeah, might as well is definitely and most notably is the terminology, how, how certain terms do define as different for different groups of people according to their culture and society and according to their personal experiences",0
" And I definitely learned that zionism especially this word with as as mary put it, it's a harsh z that could be the source of many different, many different and many multi layered, multicultural meanings",0
 Anyone else want to go jump in? I can go after you,0
 Very good taking Muhammad if he doesn't want to talk,0
 It's some the great chance to connect and to discuss with because another people want to face in in Palestine in or stand or around the world to get you guys point of view,0
 There's a great level of understanding and empathy from a lot of you out there to the plight of the Palestinians,0
 I appreciate all you guys separates especially guys,0
 And my for moderating really well yesterday so I commend you guys for all that and I hope you will continue to be a positive influence and affect your direct so your direct people that can change as well,0
" And I think we need to really keep this also uh, in the forefront for people to learn about because I haven't been enough about it",0
" Um, and uh, but I just now made in recent weeks and the Syrian friend, I didn't even know what is a Syrian, you know, it's not Syrian and there's like they're like connected to the Armenian people in certain ways, but they're not",0
" So this is something very important that I think we should also emphasis, I just want to say, uh, the same thing",0
 I do agree with you biden that just recognize that,0
" But at the same time, biden just funded uh, Azerbaijan",0
 So whoever wanted to speak on the question and then we can open it up back to conversation,0
" You can, I think I've been in here for like 30 hours on and off and it has been the most incredible conversations going up and down and all around and guy Maria Rayna, I mean I have to salute you as well as obviously margins",0
" And this is really, we are like to have clubhouse like this motion that you started the room to see where the conversation has been going and it's almost 2",0
" Hi, it's Suzanne, I was just gonna voice in this room has been beautiful for me",0
" It has been therapeutic because I have spent many days crying, wondering what I can do",0
" I truly feel like although I might not be making a difference in the the whole resolution, it just feels like I'm hearing people that truly want to make a difference and truly want there to be a peaceful resolution",0
" We're going to do more just I guess just start continuing to use the balanced club and maybe we could do with some other topics to if you guys want to follow along, but whoever wants to speak next and we can bring some people from the audience",0
 So there are many people who are going into conversation,0
 But we're just trying to just figure out what people learned and house people's minds got changed,0
" And if you want to answer, picking us up, can we hear a Palestinian place? I would love to hear",0
" But did you want to share? Do you want to just continue? Because once we continue the conversation, I'll call on you",0
 What did you learn much? Well um I like I like the room honestly speaking,0
" But I have I have listen to many misinformation that needs to be corrected so I will just leave it for now and then later on I come when we do, yeah we're calling you when we leave back in Natali Natali, would you would you like to say something to talk? Sure",0
 Um I was just wanted to say that I really appreciate this room as well because um I mean first of all I feel really humble that I'm able to have been a part of these conversations,0
 Um I feel really humble that there are people who are creating spaces for and facilitating conversations between Palestinians and Israelis,0
" And just this effort brings me so much hope and I feel a lot of um I mean you know there it's difficult because there there's a lot of heightened, there's tension, there's a lot of history and just the willingness to learn is extremely beautiful and if I could just share one thing I learned um yesterday I was sharing that my family um I'm Palestinian, but my grandmother left Well what had to leave Palestine um when she was 13 and went to Lebanon um and was forced to leave the life she ever known and really never spoke about being Palestinian because I think the trauma she faced and the fear of persecution and also these this politics somewhat in Lebanon where it's uh an officially christian country and we're christian Palestinian and she um uh was given Lebanese citizenship because she was half Palestinian, half Lebanese and christian",0
 A lot of Palestinians in Lebanon continue to live in refugee camps and are not granted citizenship and they continue to be stateless as they are in Palestine and it's extremely difficult for them and I can only imagine how difficult it was for my grandmother who passed her brothers and sisters,0
" Um for me, I equated with, you know, the institution of the faith and I know that Judaism is a religion and it's in a group of people as well as it is a religion and I own my only frame of reference is I guess Christianity and the separation in my mind of the faith of Christianity and the institution of Christianity, which is let's say the Vatican and how I would react if I had seen, you know, the Vatican annexing Italy and further encroaching on Italy and taking homes from Italians",0
" And so I thought things were, that was my family reference",0
" So it's, it's been so uh, I guess enlightening, beautiful heartening to listen to and expand my mind and see that, you know, zionism is not just what I thought it was and it's also not for me to define anti Semitism though I know my heart, I'm sorry, I feel like I took so much space",0
" Can I say a couple of words about what he just said? No, let's just stay on topic week",0
" You could address people, but right now we're just doing individual talks",0
" I've been in this room for, like I said a couple of days witnessed a few different waves of earlier, somebody was complaining that one side is the room benefits one side more than the other",0
 Uh last night I was hearing completely opposite side of saying the same thing,0
 So that also gives us an example of how at different times we can look at the same room and have completely different opinions on the same the same,0
 Uh the information is completely different at different times,0
 A couple of comments I have to make by listening for a few days,0
 Uh first I'd like to say that the terminology is extremely important,0
 And is it possible you could just share your personal experience and not a few things,0
" We don't don't address what was said, and I'm just going to say this again, I'm not talking to you, but it seems like a lot of people are going to that and there are people waiting to speak and what was asked What You don't talk about terminology, Don't talk about",0
" What has, what has your mind changed? How have you never done? Very, very quick then, Then what I see in my mind is changing",0
" So, if anyone wants to address the question and don't try to reframe it three different ways to try to get your point across",0
" It's not going to show anyone, you know, you're not going to draw people to your way",0
" So, if anyone wants to share what was changed in their mind by listening to this room, whether you're here for five minutes, this is say idea",0
 I would like to have two words about my experience in this room,0
" And uh I would really I also, I was moved by some of my Israeli brothers and sisters were able to understand uh and get moved by the Palestinian side of stories",0
 And also I want myself I want to pray for the people,0
" You know sometimes the moderators have done an excellent job in trying to limit the harmful interaction of people who are unable to do that, unable to suppress their anger and rage",0
 And it's just so sad for me that we still cannot do this,0
" And I'm so I'm not not even post its certainty, Peace will come",0
" Just a statement saying one would be, let's support palace to the new year label Anti Semetic",0
 Exactly what Mohammed mentioned the same recycled art tears your athletic,0
 I just think that argument itself for some reason only attached to the Palestinian must all income from the Palestinians,0
 So it was so my memory goes back to when it was just Egyptian and Palestinian orders,0
" No it's really but like you bringing up these things, I'm starting to remember stuff that like I remember at some point, well people are we're living so they were entering the Israeli border from the Egyptian border",0
" I remember them getting a man, so obviously you have to go through metal detectors",0
" I remember once after we all went through the metal detectors and my auntie was with us and she was pregnant and she was begging she's like I'm pregnant, I cannot go into these metal detectors because obviously she's pregnant and they're not good for they're not good for the baby",0
 And that's just why because he's going punk is pretty to Gaza which is you know shouldn't be a which shouldn't be you know we shouldn't be treated in this way,0
 Um I have like a lot a lot like the amount of things we went through on the Egyptian side on like as you said like after the torture of like then I remember how you said you went with the V,0
 We tried to be I passed on the Egyptian border once,0
 And so it was basically so the border like to get to the actual building where you stamp your passport you need to get across and outside border which is like a 10 minute no not even maybe a 10 minute walk,0
 So because we were Children at the time my parents were like well just pay and instead of having to like walk this basic even more than 10 minutes actually 20 minutes maybe we'll just pay for the best to get us exactly inside,0
" Like if I recall correctly, the bus picked us about 10",0
 From the area we were in and then one hour drive 11 am,0
 We were outside the Borders at the outside borders and the bus was not allowed to move and we saw people who had been there four days trying to enter and that time we stayed outside in the sun and Egypt is very hot in the summer For over like 11 12 hours,0
 They let us they finally let us in the border to get our passport stamped once we got there we got there also it took long again as she said like you know you're having a foreign passport does not speed anything up for you,0
" They can like one instance it was thrown in our face like go take your passport and drink it like wet it and drink its water kind of, it's in Arabic saying below tomato kind of thing like what are you doing with your past? Like we don't care about it basically",0
" And because we're foreigners we have to we have a foreign passport, we have to wait extra time for our passport information to go all the way to like extremely intelligence or whatever",0
" And as she, but at this point I'm describing a time where there was no Israeli size",0
" So I just go back to like the Palestinian side and we got in there like you know for me, you know how she said, you know, take this sister was uh was the biggest relief for her for us",0
 We were literally just got off the bus and we were standing on a grassy area because the Palestinian area was very full of people,0
" My little brother was crying like I need water, I need water again",0
" This was the tastiest, most refreshing water I've ever drunk in my life",0
" And that was like the first time I actually felt, you know how in books they described the air of your country",0
" That was when I like felt the air of Palestine and I was like, oh my God, I'm in Palestine",0
" And and these memories and as she said, these things are what make us, you know, fight for it, this is what makes us want to be in Palestine another",0
 Now the border like the Egyptian To get from Cairo to the borders usually takes four hours,0
" This time it took us 12 hours because even though we paid VIP, imagine I'm just talking um the way because of all the restrictions that are happening, just the road from the Cairo airport to the border took 12 hours and that's for people who pay extra",0
" So we paid like for each person, like a big amount of money and then again, this is a privilege",0
" I'm not going to talk, I'm not going to like this is not the point of this story",0
" We go through one day, put our bags out, open our luggage and then just throw them on the ground and we have to collect them",0
 I'm not going to go into details about that because it's this is not the point of my story,0
" But when we got, we got into Gaza we're finished, there's like recently Israel have our started allowing Palestinians to leave Gaza through through the Jordanian border",0
" No, everyone is like lucky enough to get out but thankfully I don't know",0
" Yeah, thanks for the I guess we were one of those people and that experience on its own was for me one of the like one of the most heartbreaking experiences because we're going on to a bus after we finished all the like, you know, you know, so let me you know, so preparing for this travel through Israel, we're not allowed to carry any products that has like liquids in them so no makeup, no perfumes",0
" Everyone like imagine like, you know, people who are coming to say goodbye to us are like don't take this, forget about this shoes, you're only allowed to shoes with you per person is it? Actually? Yeah, I think It's either one or 2 shoes, I'm more inclined to think",0
" Yeah, I think it's two shoes you're not allowed anything with metal in it, you know, so like, like literally your bags, your luggage, it's not allowed to have wheels",0
" So all of our luggage was left there and you're carrying our things with us in our house path of our belongings were still there, we left, we had to leave them behind",0
" Like all your person like, you know, a toothbrush you can't carry with you",0
 You can unless you get a specific uh huh allowance or specific,0
" But you know, we have people that are leaving and they have their hands up and I just realized that they're all gone and I'm not trying to take away from your story, but please we do know these injustices",0
" But if you know, you can get to your like your punch point because we have heard like, I don't know, I don't know if I'm sorry if I'm I just feel like we have some new voices that uh, and as moderators, you know, I still feel like we should always be discourse",0
" And just found I felt bad a little bit for going on for lunch, so I'm just gonna go quickly where I'm getting out",0
" I hate to say this word, but yeah, we left and then they put us one of us in this bus, we had a police car right behind this, in a police car in front of us because we we weren't allowed to leave this bus until we reach the Jordanian border",0
" So for example, and just see it from a window and knowing that it's like a couple of miles away and then you're just not allowed to go down and see it",0
 And so because he really wants to help help Palestine um with with good government infrastructure,0
 Doing some things and um there was this giant conference that it was the APAC conference and I didn't know what that was,0
 And when I started hearing what they were saying and it struck me how these people this this a pack group was completely dehumanizing everybody that was in the Palestinian state,0
" And I thought what in the world is going on here and my friends, we were just shocked",0
 And and then I realized also how much power that this group actually has,0
" And they would go around in groups and clusters to to the Congress people's office to get, you know, to ask for this funding at the same time completely dehumanizing everyone saint Palestine",0
" And and then when I, you know, so you fast fast forward years later and my I get to meet my friend Jasim and he's telling me these you know, stories about just how he, you know the trip the trip he had to take to get from from Palestine, he's in Gaza to Estonia to start our you know our school there, I was just absolutely floored and in tears and and so you know when I found out he was there last week and the bombings began, it was it was quite a rush to try to find out if he was okay, but I just wanted to let you guys know that there are people in the US who do understand what's going on and we're speaking up, we're not being silent and and it's hard, I will tell you it's hard because in in places like where I live, I I live in Oklahoma um that are very republican, very conservative and they conflate the, you know supporting of jesus and Christianity with supporting what's going on with with palace with Israel",0
 Can I please respond to that first of all boomer sooner,0
" So Oklahoma is near and dear to my heart, I love it",0
" Um and you know you you brushed on the fact that like yeah, thank you first of all for letting us know like where you stand and and I know I know there are americans that are with us once they find out the truth and that's just the hardest part is to penetrate that brainwashing that they went through",0
 These of these actions by the UN is to continue the reason for the between the conflict,0
" 700,000 Palestinians are expelled which was this was literally you know, other last week",0
" So in my opinion, solving this issue is not by solving the symptoms symptoms",0
" Why? Also mainly because 85% Sorry, excuse me, excuse me, just one second, I'm sorry",0
" Please surrender the microphone when? Okay, Thank you",0
 And I would like to start by saying mo I apologize,0
 Are you gonna be are you gonna again? The format is we want to address the comments and a question that we just made,0
" Is there any perspective you want to share on what I just said? If not we'll reserve, will reserve will come back to you as a speaker in order that we're going please? All right",0
" No need if there is no question to answer or no additional perspective, that's fine",0
 I I can I have something to say in response to them And I also had a question um would it be all right if I said both or do you want me to just respond for now? Go ahead and just respond because I would like to turn it back to Lonnie for for order,0
" Um so growing up, you know, I'm a jewish american, I do have a lot of Israeli family",0
" Um and we say every year on Passover for thousands of years, we've said next year in Jerusalem",0
 Um Guy I did see you flash your mic and or come off you,0
" Um was there something you want to say? Who me? Yeah, maybe it was a mistake with not in orders",0
" Yeah, I've got something I gotta say super quick and then let's continue with Monty's PTR",0
" I just wanna say super quick that um the word anti Semitic was invented by a dude named William Maher and like the 18 hundreds, 18 hundreds and um 19 hundreds I should say",0
" Um even if you are a Semitic language speaker, thank you",0
" I would just guys really quickly, I would suggest this rule of thumb",0
" And then when you tweet that come and tell me that you think that you're a semite, I'll accept the whole thing",0
" Please don't make that, argued that false argument about Semitism",0
 I just want to make sure I'm not taking anyone else because I seem to be able to do like a few other people in front of me,0
" But yeah sure I'll go ahead and share, Lonnie Lonnie is taking care of the order so guys don't worry about it because there's there's been some movement on the stage so go ahead, appreciate it",0
 I kind of just had like I mean I agree with George and guy and also Melanie regarding the comment because I am Israeli myself and I was a quick story for myself,0
 Like people are sharing stories and I've spoken in the room about days ago,0
" Um But the one big thing like for me um like I might be still living in Israel today if if um things in the past when I was born and when my mother and my family lived there um there was war like in the sense that there was bombs being dropped um through the through the time of were um it wasn't Palestine, it was he ran through Saddam Hussein and I'm just saying that in the in the way that um there has been a lot that's gone through Israel throughout the time that you know people feel threatened to stay there and every single time you know um Israel has gone through a some sort of you know war or fight or battle or however someone defines it um we're still there and the thing is a lot of people have were, the funny thing is I've met so many different people around the world from who live in Canada now in the U",0
" Um But but yeah no the quick story, the thing that I wanted to say is throughout the time that you know my mother was in Israel for about five years, I was also born there",0
" Um There was a lot of a lot of disaster, a lot of you know buildings that are no longer there um that have been hit and during this time this was in the early 1990s, um late 1980s and and people who may have been there I was and I was a baby at that time um but you know the it created a lot of like psychological issues for a lot of people and people like my mother, like I haven't been back to Israel since then um because two reasons, but another reason is um the the scarcity that my mother or my family has endured um just being there and I would, you know funny enough I was supposed to go to Israel in in 2020 but of course the pandemic occurred and I didn't travel but I was so excited to head back um and to really explore it and try it, but of course at this moment of time I feel unsafe to go back um And you know I just I want everyone to have the opportunity um Everything from you know from birthright to elia to anything else that's out there",0
" Um You know humanity should be the first thing on everyone's list um causing causing harm to each other is not a thing that I think most people in this room can agree on, we don't want to cause pain, we don't want to cause harm, we want to be peaceful",0
" Be connective can be open, be able to understand both sides and connect with people because everyone has a different perspective, but be able to understand the perspective, educate yourself on their perspective and also give your perspective so that other person can also educate themselves on your perspective",0
" And um I think we all in the end can find a common ground and I think thank you for the opportunity for the time, Thank you all",0
" Um does anyone have a question for DJ or can I move on to the next speaker? Yes, I have a question for D",0
" If it's nice to say wishes, you know, we're coming now out of work and you are saying wishes we have here Those wishes for the last 73 years",0
" If as its peaceful as it was during all of the 16,000 years back, if you keep on guys doing this atrocities, stop doing atrocities, then we will say how we can solve our problem",0
 What's happening now? Everybody is hurting you guys,0
 And there are many people even in Israel who say why do we even accept this money? And then the next thing is keep in mind this also makes up a very very small amount of money that the US spends on defence and also small amount of money that the U,0
 I hope this answers your question and that's just my um meat gives it to me,0
 I have a question that I follow up with this butter,0
" And for that to be kept, we ensure the piece by paying Egypt that money",0
 But also there they are a very big part of our social fabric and Americans for the past,0
 Um seven poll 60 of the last 70 years have had a very strong emotional bond with Israel because so many of us personally know people who are Jewish and we feel very strongly about the self determination of the Jewish state because we have such a large constituency with whom we have strong social and cultural ties,0
" Including the work week, the idea of a weekend child labor laws, food packing laws to make sure that we have high standards of food",0
" Remember this was father in 1948, just three years after the horrors that the whole world learned about it during the Second World War",0
 Israel is by that time the only real democratic country in the whole of the Middle East,0
" Only democratic country, a small countries are being threatened""}],""items"":[{""start_time"":""0",0
" On a good on a good day of crossing trip takes about six hours, 6 or seven hours",0
" And and and, and it's not just on the Israeli side, right? I mean it's on both sides, but the majority of it, it's that one center checkpoint",0
" We were just almost felt like we were in a prison camp just waiting to get on a freakin bus which at that point you're still waiting and and you know you're melting basically from the heat um to go to the other, stop checkpoint to go and get, you know, interrogate again etcetera",0
" But it is a very humane experience, it is a very painful experience",0
" Just like I can fly into Canada from the US or help, just like you can go from Chicago to michigan and drive without anybody stopping me to say where's your I",0
" Or where is your this or is your that and are you Palestinian or not? So um Anyways, thank you for that alexander Mahmoud, I think we did go to you, I wasn't sure if there was something else that you were going to share",0
 I don't in any way support the continued occupation,0
 I support a two state solution according to the previous peace deals that have been on the table,0
" Um my mother's family from Morocco, my wife's parents are both from Tripoli, from Libya, um a big gala B and I want people just in the audience just be mindful that there is a very western narrative here",0
 Ahmadiyya Muslims can practice their faith freely um within the state of Israel,0
" Um The stories here, we're hearing about checkpoints and uh tourism",0
" My son has never been uh to the West Bank once, I took him to see some Palestinian friends in East Jerusalem",0
" And if you hear people on this platform talking stories about this, it's not",0
 And that's I mean I've got a lot to say about I'll let other people speak,0
" Robin, you have to hit your on you buying us here and you go there you go",0
 Um and for the first time in a very long time it feels reassuring to be in a community of people talking about their own experiences and histories and putting stories to faces,0
 Um So I wanted to share a link that is in my profile to an art project by Jr and Margot who are street artists,0
 And they did a large scale project in um basically on the wall built between Israel and Palestine featuring faces of Palestinians next to Israelis,0
" Um and I wanted to share this with the moderators not necessarily share here, but I feel like it's a really important visual uh story of humans and um the fact that when you put two people next to each other with no real description, it's really hard to tell where they're, where they're from, Sometimes it depends on the person obviously, but our stories, I feel like sometimes we're defined by our stories when really we're all human",0
" Um My grandparents Eventually moved to Poland and then Israel, where most of my family lives",0
 I think as an american who just suffered through four years of trump and who continues to be under this Republican party that makes decisions that have nothing to do with my beliefs,0
" Um and the government of Israel is represented in a very small number of people and I was just looking at my passport, someone mentioned, you know, I have a stamp from the first time I went to Israel when I was less than two years old and I have I have vivid memories of going to Israel every few years throughout my entire life um meeting some Palestinian women in France and almost going to Gaza the last time I was in Israel and I didn't get the chance but um I didn't intend to speak today",0
" Um and I just shared this project that jr the face to face project, because I think it's important, um but I'm so thankful because I've been feeling so lost and disheartened by so much of the rhetoric around what's happening um between, you know, humans in um Israel and Palestine, and I've been trying to figure out how to speak out against it and just being here today, like being on here for 12 plus hours, um Hearing stories, I realized like that is what I really and here for right now is to hear stories of people who have been affected by this um the division and the unrest that is really the product of like a few people and it affects the majority",0
" Um and if you go to my profile, you can see the link to this project",0
" Um I want to thank every single person for being here at the moderators, just like, so much respect for what you're doing",0
" Um I can't wait to invite more people in and my Israeli, I intend to reach out to my Israeli family",0
" Um and this is also I think a really good opportunity for so many people, like a catalyst for conversation around a really hard subject",0
" Um so thank you for letting me share, I can't believe I actually um um and just like a lot of gratitude for what's happening in this space and check out the JR project",0
" Um he also has a ted talk, but the uh the project I featured in my profile is specifically Faces of Palestinians next to Israelis, uh farmers next to farmers, twin sisters and brothers and um you know, you can't tell about, you can't tell who's Palestinian and who's in who's Israeli just by looking at that, like we're all human sharing this human experience and thank you for this group because I feel so connected to humanity through it",0
" Um I've been at it for a while, um but before we do that, I just want to say something real quickly",0
" Um so folks, please please please don't always have a ton of people raising their hands",0
" Unfortunately, most of you do not have anything in your profile",0
" Um put something in your profile, connect to social media if you have it",0
" And even more importantly, put on top of your profile a sentence, some statement about what you want to talk about or um or the question that you would like to ask",0
" I just will take the opportunity to mention the startup in Gaza that I was talking about, that had their premises demolished",0
 Mohammed abu matter is a young guy who is the founder and uh some of his friends started this crowdfunding campaign and I put it on my twitter feed and it's the first thing of my profile,0
 I I've been following you guys for for a few days and I have I have uh and I love I love the fact that there is dialogue and I love the fact there's both people speaking up and it's it's really awesome,0
" Nor right, so so reach out if you know how to help or if you want to help and and broaden this",0
 And the last group I got tonight was how fast I was blocked,0
 I can guarantee you there is 3000 reports went in less than one minute nothing happened to the I can guarantee you with him,0
" I just call it whatever you wanna call it, right, right, wrong",0
" I don't care at this point, there is no right and there is no wrong because all of the principles has been twisted to a no terminology, right? I get blocked on the spot",0
 So you know what? They do their part and we will do ours peace,0
 I saw how you interacted emotionally in that regard,0
" And yeah, it's difficult for our Palestinian uh, words to be heard, but we have been getting some reach",0
 And this is how we win the war or quote unquote win the war,0
" We are not there, so we can't help them on the ground, but we can educate to help the Israelis",0
 Find out more about what their government is doing to them and two other people of course,0
" And uh, last thing regarding your comment about you being blocked",0
" I think it was the club house rules of disrespecting others and, and uh, and language, I think that's why you probably got locked",0
" Uh, yes, emotions take a lot of part in these conversations",0
 I saw you in a different point of view because of the way you attacked whatever that guy's name is instead of trying to educate him,0
" But what I'm saying is the smallest room I opened, it had 200 people in it",0
" Trust me, I know I'm not going back to the clubhouse like an educated and honest",0
 There's nobody that's gonna understand more than me,0
" But if it takes another four years of frustration, but to educate every person we reach is away",0
 That's why my department is not today in the educational one,0
" I didn't mean I was talking to my son, I didn't mean to, I didn't know I was unknown muted, but I did want to ask a question",0
 So Today after 73 years it's a pretty much impossible to tell Israelis get out right? So my my thoughts are a one state solution,0
 I know that's gonna be impossible but there are certain steps that we could take to get to the end result and to start off by ending the occupation because that's the biggest issue right now is what needs to be done,0
" And I think that ending the occupation has to come in within just like the Blm movement, it came, it came within no other country in the world happened out the U",0
" The Israelis have to acknowledge the occupation and oppression of the Palestinian people and they have to whether it's a revolt against their government or whatnot or do whatever they need to do to end the occupation, That's number one, number two is stop the illegal settlements because that's just increasing the amount of Israelis that are going into that land",0
 Uh and that's going to create the population issue which is going to create the whole occupation again or the suppression of the Palestinian people and here and I do believe that today We are miles away from where we were 10 years ago or a year ago because of social media and people are becoming more aware of the situation,0
 They can stay there Yet again that this assembly of the Israeli state is on the table,0
 We can use the South african example And how they operated there,0
 It took a little bit of time but it did not take 73 years and it worked,0
" If you use out of too many of our brain out of Palestine and the Ashkenazis, Mizrahi's, all of those, They are different from each other in the eyes of the law within the state",0
" I'm not disagreeing with you, but to joe's point, it's uh P 1914 when we when we said Saddam Hussein is a tyrant, we took him down, right? So may as well, we can take the state their 100% 100%",0
" But to joe's point Pre 1948, jews christians and Muslims lived in harmony altogether",0
" So, so the only thing that changed is it became the state of Israel",0
" So definitely um oppression needs to stop, the one sided war needs to stop and once that happens, I think that will be the biggest catalyst",0
" They're just by stopping this one sided war just by removing the blockades, just by removing the military checkpoints",0
 And I think then we can we can maybe like revisit that and go from there,0
 Those people need to pay for the crimes they've done,0
" Sure, but at the end of the day, someone needs to be held accountable accountability is one of the biggest things that's gonna let us get over this and go back as a lot",0
" The muslim state, we never wanted a muslim state in Palestine, it was never called that it can be a land for all because we do respect all religions there",0
" We want to live among everybody there, but it's very hard to forget what's been done to us",0
" But I do think this accountability will at least let us move forward and that I think if I can add, I mean, just you have to look at it this way go, it's like justice has to come first, Liberty has to come next",0
 Um and then peace and reconciliation can come after,0
 It's like the one state solution is kind of like removing an oppressive regime and with removing the oppressive regime and the justice comes trying war criminals that have okay,0
 And then we'll so another question is um so let's say we do that,0
" There's a they remove the block, they don't they don't expand, they don't go settle in more territories, they removed the blockades",0
 But then there's the issue of say your ancestors lived in java or tel Aviv and they had houses that were taken from them,0
" Does that all how how does that get? I mean, who owns what with with from a real estate wise people live in Israel or uh in the occupied territories, have a house, they work, they bought at their house and um but then your great great grandfather used to live there",0
" Uh My thoughts are like my grandfather lived there, not my great, great, great great grandfather is just my grandfather",0
" So to be able to get to my point, my father lived there until he was in his early teens",0
" But me personally, I'm not going to go back and ask for a house that somebody lives in because that's just going back to the same cycle and repeating everything since I am doing what exactly",0
" Since I'm the living proof, I can tell you, I have moved on",0
" No, and I think another really important thing, what did he leave that guilt is I don't know, I didn't kick him out",0
" I'm Maria, I'm your moderate Iraqi catholic on the stage",0
 So I would like to speak on that since you brought it up in this room,0
" So we better understand how to have a dialogue in a way that's honoring to to all humans, because I don't think it's ok to for anyone to, you know? Yeah, I just don't think it's ok for for people to leave the space feeling this heart and thinking that this is what we're trying to do with our platform",0
" So guy and and Maria and and Rania, who's who's next? And Ryan is good to see you here",0
 So I've always known that one day we'll be working together on this,0
" I literally we need to Maria, that's why I love you because we both love both people and I think most people here if they didn't come with that love for both people are slowly uh learning to love both their people and the other people",0
 I think that's the key of what we're trying to achieve here,0
 So who was next? Was there please on mute And we are listening however was next I think I was hello everybody,0
 I'm grateful that I can meet Palestinians and jewish people from all over the world and can hear your story,0
" But what can I say is that I feel so grateful that I have the dollar sight of my, my Romanian uh that can bring me some some objectivity um and some calmness",0
 Even so I emphasize a lot with the Palestinian and also with the two people because every one of them has a reality and I can agree with each one of them,0
 But I think that the politic side of the things um catch up and bring us to this way of putting the story in a line and it's hard for me two to see like a solution,0
" I hope that in my life I will see one and I will be happy to go to my grandfather village from, from Palestine",0
 And also I liked it Uh seeing like the Muslim and the Orthodox people because I'm I was born here in Romania and uh here are more than 80% of the people are orthodox,0
 Uh and I'm open to enter in any uh any any place of God,0
" Uh, I don't know, first energy that brings me peace",0
" And I hope that we we could and I think these kind of discussions even so they are, they're hard because we have emotions and probably I don't have so much than people that are living, I don't know in Gaza or in West Bank because it's hard for me to imagine to not have this that kind of emotion where if I will, I would live there",0
" Um even so, I have a lot of liberties where where do I live? Um I hope that we could be more, I don't know, understandable with each other and accept each other and feel like we are all citizens citizens of the world",0
 I I had Maria call my name out area but I was unable to speak at the time,0
" Uh just once I can excuse me, Mr be a gentleman and let the lady go first",0
" I just wanted to confirm with the mods, but it's okay",0
" Thank you so much for moderating such an inspiring talk between both Israelis and Palestinians, and it's really beautiful to hear everyone's opinions and stories so far",0
" Um following on from what was just spoken about, um I wanted to pose a question to majority of the Israelis within this conversation, um there has been a lot of conversation and sentiment to live in a world where where Palestinians and Israelis are united and that is really beautiful to hear",0
" And it's really hard woman to hear that, you know, firsthand from yourselves with regards to an earlier question that I think in your post as well, about the government's actions with regards to the Israeli government, How is that reflecting these ideals from what you can see so far and in your personal opinion, What on the ground are actions that could be taken in the future to make this realistic and make this dream a reality of of unity? Um what do you think is your opinion and how could this actually genuinely go forward? Thank you so much",0
" Sophia just so you get the precise answers, actions on the ground by the Israeli government",0
" Like what should we be voting for, do you mean or? Yeah, generally as well and general opinions on what could be done going forward? Thank you",0
" Um Yeah, okay, I don't see flashing mix and so I guess I will answer you have to take you guys",0
" So yeah, I think I heard Rania's question earlier and I guess you're asking of my opinion on Israel's government's current policies, do I stand behind them? Do I condemn condemn them this kind of a question Before the 2nd part? Sofia",0
" So I I will speak definitely on behalf of my own but also I will suggest that even though obviously I do not represent a majority of voices in Israel, I'm also not singular or alone",0
" Uh yeah, I uh sadly uh I want to say happily, but that's really not the right word",0
" Right, So I condemn a lot of Israel's policies when and especially when it comes to the Palestinian issue, also other issues internally other Israeli policies of course and I have stopped giraffe in my profile because I think that that was something that could have been and should have been stopped by the Israeli government and I called for the end of the occupation and I call for equal rights and so all of these things can and should be implemented by the Israeli government and yet they're not and so on these and many other issues, we don't only call them out, but we go out to the streets and and we waved banners and we strike and we do everything we can within the democratic process to bring about that change that we want to see in Israel",0
 American patriots were criticizing that policy and they were doing that not because they hated America but because they loved it and they wanted to see a better America,0
" And so from that, from that point of view, I speak up against uh policies in my country",0
" I'll I guess uh, this conversation is very new to me as a, as a religious jew and as someone who is surrounded by friends and family who are quite right wing",0
" And if I, if I had to place myself on the political spectrum, I would also say that's that's where I stand on a lot of things",0
 So I just want to say thank you to everyone for expressing their opinions,0
 There's a lot of ways of thinking and ways of speaking here that are that are are new to me,0
" Um in terms of supporting the government, I I have to agree with the guy that there there are certain things that the the government is doing that are very problematic and I'll just share for talking about realities on the ground",0
" You know, I have family in incarnation one, which is which is a settlement in the West Bank",0
" So I spent the weekend with them and I took the bus uh to see my family, and for me it was very easy",0
" And they knew that when we reached the checkpoint they got up and they and they left the bus and to me that was extremely frustrating and two to here to see that and to know that they can't just go around like I can and move around like I can't, it's frustrating for me",0
" It's also frustrating that in the last week, because of because of Hamas, I went into a bomb shelter many times and near me in the bomb shelter there were there were babies and little kids whose parents were struggling to explain to them what was going on",0
 And I think it's important to remember that and I want to thank everyone for for their perspectives,0
" Again, loan that was really beautiful and unique because on one hand, you you uh, you voice your fear and express a need to vote for security",0
" I know you're new york, I think somebody is a muted if you don't mind muting",0
" And I suggest that if you spend more time with the salon, some of that fear might dissipate",0
 And you will see that perhaps the human rights and the suffering on the other side Might be more important than 100% sense of security,0
 So I just want to thank all the mods and I want to thank everyone here,0
 We ask you to be respectful to everyone in the room,0
 We are the dictators and that's how we keep it running smoothly,0
" And I'll just remind everybody, this is the room where you meet Palestinians and Israelis who show up with very different perspectives, histories, narratives and visions for the future",0
" People have been waiting for hours to participate in this conversation, but we would also like to focus specifically on Palestinian and Israeli narratives and specifically personal narratives and lived experiences",0
" So who is next in line? We would like to hear from you, please",0
" Uh when I was a kid, um soldiers, Israeli soldiers, it just went at our house a To check like just a random house, there's nothing but me and my uh my brother when I was like 10 or 11 years old and they told us just to go out and uh to the wall and both brought a gun into my head and now I'm not afraid, but I was like thinking um I'm a kid, I'm gonna I'm 10 years old",0
 So I think if if if they took in orders for not doing that um it would be good and uh something like we lied to accept that Israel is uh estate is existing,0
" Um That's very heartbreaking to hear, and I also want to say that yeah, b we are scared",0
 You are being drafted to perpetuate this human rights atrocities and as you shouldn't be so levelheaded applique,0
" But we will take it step by step because the people of Gaza and the people of the West Bank, they need a better reality today and not in a in the utopia, beautiful world of the future",0
" Anybody has anybody has some hold on Andrea finished, anybody has stuff as the state, write it down and then hopefully you can contain it in your memory",0
 So it went from like 8% up to like 50 maybe 30% 30 50% by late 1940s,0
" Um, I don't want to get the partition plan, but just look up the partition plan",0
" And so basically what happens is uh, on college campuses, their demonstrations and people are learning about this and passing information around",0
" And so now we're coming to this reckoning point and uh, I'm done speaking Cool, cool",0
" We actually had Sam Sam and then after Sam Sam, we have Hamid and then after Hamid, we have urine",0
" So Sam sam, if you're here and you're ready, you can go ahead and speak",0
" Um, and they've lived in peace um, since forever, like before designers, colonizers can't Palestine",0
" Um, I would say that's comparable to the european settler to colonize America um, and estimate sleek lines",0
" Um So yeah, it's not like a simple thing for it's not a war",0
 Is a country that labels Hamas a terrorist organization and I'm not saying they are aren't,0
 In my opinion has absolutely no right to label anyone or anything a terrorist organization,0
 I mean this is the same country that label nelson Mandela a terrorist available Malcolm X terrorist,0
 Also Hamas um like it was mentioned earlier was established in 1987,0
" And Palestinians have been oppressed since 1948 or even before that um when the Israeli colonizers came from europe and still the land, so that's 39 years of zero accountability",0
" Um it's either you're without prosper, you're with the president and that's why I take them out, appreciate that same, same, keep pushing",0
" Uh I I lived in the earth for two years, I did my masters degree there, I think I saw Palestinians and Israelis there",0
 And also I am like I've worked in West Bank as a voluntary worker,0
" This thing is going on for like 74 years, first of all didn't have running water",0
 Second of all this school for example was 15 minutes away from their place and some of them had to go through two hours or three hours like ways to get to school because they have to go through a lot of checkpoints or whatever,0
 Uh There are a lot of incidents happening in their camp,0
" Like I remember I was I walked in their camp and one of them, there was a photo of someone up there like they just put a photo of like a 14 year old kid and I just asked uh this elderly guy that what's happened to this kid and they were like yeah they were protesting and one of them like like a 14 year old kid to to Iraq at these I don't know, occupation forces or whatever and they snapped him down",0
" I don't want like I don't want to like uh I don't want people to believe me or don't believe me, but I'm just trying to say what I saw and uh like in general uh they were like they have our story, we can always change",0
 And so that left a profound impact on on me tonight and that's what I wanted to share,0
" Um, he just is quiet, we're not saying anything and I don't care about the politics",0
 I just wanted to say that this is actually happening in daily basis to people,0
 They don't have pretty much any primitive thing you could think of like they should walk for for like hours to get some water,0
" Like settlers who are living in West Bank, they have access to 70% of the queen water which is there",0
" And I don't know like read for yourself, educate yourself and remember not taking side is taking is taking the side of officer",0
 So and it's quite clear who is the officer here? So whatever I'm done speaking who who up next coach Marine I believe,0
 Um the argument by um for is that um zionists always bring to the table is obviously Hamas,0
" So I wanted to just um talk about it for a second and again, what we always say, they always use Hamas as pretext",0
" Okay, and the thing is, Israel does not target just Hamas Children, women, innocent civilians are always the one who pay the price",0
" And again, Hamas is the symptom, As someone mentioned, they were founded in the 1980s after decades of genocide and of course there are the result of the occupation",0
" Again, great example nelson Mandela, that is the best example possible because he was also seen as a terrorist when these people, what they're doing is called resistance and now what Andrea she just left what Andrea said, which is so problematic, the fact that they always try to use one incident or a couple incidents to um you get to that victim victimhood that they love and adore so much and always go back to they love being victims",0
" So yes, those cases, those small incidents that have been one in new york new york, even though it has been proven that it was a provocation, we must know that these people, the Palestinians, they have been oppressed for so long",0
" That doesn't justify anything still, but at the same time only if your country doesn't commit any kind of human violation human rights, but and in the air is is going to be the challenge especially now with when things start to calm down",0
 Um I don't think that the the government of Israel expected this to happen,0
" They've been doing things like this um for years, it's not really that different, it's not substantively that different except that it was Aqsa on the 27th night of Ramadan and you know, they've all they've been consistently pushing the limits of how they interact with the Aqsa compound digging underneath it for the for several years, marching around every Ramadan",0
" I mean it's kind of when I saw it, I didn't think that this would happen, I was sad about it, but I was sad about it in the same way that I mean this happens every year and it gets worse and I've been, you know, there's nothing that we can do that substantively different",0
But the response this ime around has been changed and has everything to do with the people that have been building coalitions with Black Lives Matter,0
"all jews and Israelis should leave Palestine, it should be Palestinian and for Palestinians and they should all come home and live happily ever after.",1
"kill all the Jews, there's nothing to do with anything.",1
"the jews are living under the Palestinians, whether equal rights or not.",1
it's all ours and Israel should be demolished.,1
Muslims across the world and spreading false narrative.,1
Israel is this demonic nation that is suiting up to kill Palestinian Children,1
"the american jews, they don't understand nuance as much whatever",1
they were unjust Muslims live in spain For almost 950 years.,1
"we're gonna bring also crusaders, mascaras to Muslims and other nations.",1
we were standing on a grassy area because the Palestinian area was very full of people.,1
a fanatic muslim regime who is neglecting destroying a country and a nation.,1
You are nothing but a Palestinian here. Which I thought it sounded very derogatory even at 10 years old.,1
we're gonna crush Israel in this war and they won't exist anymore and then and then you can come back and reclaim your homes.,1
"do you support Israel's right to exist? So, um that doesn't seem to me like a reasonable question.",1
"I would just propose that Arabs sorry, Palestinians who are citizens of Israel uh they are second class citizens.",1
"Israel is a nation for jews only, it's not a nation for all people.",1
I do not understand muslim tradition at all.,1
"I don't understand why the Israeli people, we can't hear you, you're cutting off.",1
"Israel built the wall, the Israeli settlers brought those wild pigs.",1
Hamas in Palestine we can't uh we can't get rid of them,1
no jews or dogs allowed and jews weren't allowed to join clubs.,1
"when Palestinians are given freedom and more rights, that suddenly it's going to be chaos and there's gonna be a lot of violence.",1
we want to end Israel or a kick Israel is out or any of that.,1
"Well look how the Arabs treat each other, how they treat their women as if kind of saying.",1
this is. a Israelis against arab issue where one is nice to women and one is not,1
I actually noticed misogyny and sexism was when I moved to the US to attend college.,1
"many Israelis I spoke with had no idea and no, even smart people that I know and appreciate on professional level, had no idea that the Palestinians have any merit.",1
"There was no Holocaust actually, even that will create this need for the Jews to move, to move to Palestine.",1
we're not allowing Muslims to pray.,1
So I just wanted to know if this kind of proposal for resettlement of Palestinian refugees for their complete human needs um to be met in Canada is an option that the Palestinians would consider.,1
don't link Israel to Judaism. It is miserable.,1
Some of my best enemies are Muslims.,1
I mean we get a lot of hate from so many Muslims,1
"I will take my Palestinian brothers and sisters and tell them well I'll relocate you to Pakistan to wherever Saudi Arabia where where I could, you know and take care of you.",1
"it became very clear to me that obviously the Palestinian people are not quote unquote, like war hungry, right?",1
"I would like to terrorize to rise the Palestinians, people dominate, dominate vanquish.",1
everybody sympathizes with the plot of jews in the Second World War.,1
in all Palestinians are supporting Hamas or supporting extreme views.,1
"and I know how to deal with Palestinians and I know how to deal with the Israelis. Um for me then your future, there is no peace.",1
"Uh, it was really just about finding the jews homeland because they weren't really wanted in europe.",1
"Israel is a cancer movement, causing causing the jews around the world.",1
Palestinians are not indigenous.,1
these villages deserve to be massacred,1
you know you need to disarm Israel because Israel is the danger in the Middle East,1
"I think Palestinians are oppressed, but let's let's make Israelis feel safe",1
I need to oppose the existence of Israel.,1
"Every child every 17 year old, every 18 year old teenager has to go to indoctrination for two years to do what to hate Palestinians.",1
"Check Palestinians at checkpoints, that's right.",1
"you produce the propaganda and the fucking jewish community to manipulate your ways around things. You know what? That's bullshit. And I'm gonna say this and I'm gonna say it once the land is for the Palestinians, whether you like it or not, you are not the upper hand, you are fucking way below fucking.",1
"You have the whole armies of the world, We don't give a fuck. One of us will take thousands and thousands of people down, right? Because we are the owners of the land.",1
"deal with it because Hamas, that's what's sticking up your ass, they're gonna fuck you up",1
"This sounds very fucking intelligent, idiots, fucking motherfucker. I think I can speak here. No, no, nobody fucking can talk. This is exactly the Israeli way.",1
"I'm sick of putting Palestinians down, you motherfucker, I wish your mom gets raped and your sister and you told her because this is and whoever does get the fuck out of the room.",1
. I heard him say that he is going to go down to a one Palestinian I fucking from his people.,1
I will go down to the poor borders and start shooting their fucking army down and fucking create a war because I'm sick of them saying that there's the superpowers of the world.,1
we've been trying to say for all these years and it's not that we don't like jewish people and all this nonsense.,1
"I've been hearing this a lot tonight basically. Arabs are shit. Israelis have created everything. Even God was created by Israel. Yeah, this is what I wanted to get.",1
"the land is for the Palestinians, whether you like it or not, you are not the upper hand, you are fucking way below fucking.",1
"and by the way, Israel is an ecological disaster.",1
it's really important to understand that the jews were fooled over here and there were brainwashed.,1
"I don't know. Yeah, honey, you know what? I'm very proud that I gave up my american citizenship. I'm proud that I'm back to Jordan.",1
Have you heard of killing Children is justified? Raping woman is justified.,1
"I'll always be tagged as an arab and to be honest, I was sick of that.",1
imagine there's 100 and 20 million Egyptians. Do you know if each one spits on that country that they will drown.,1
We can't allow Palestinians to be thrown into a room to meet people that are so pro Israel and so brainwashed.,1
I'll do nothing but dedicate them for the hatred of Israel and its existence and God is my witness,1
Israel and Zionism is some kind of a colonialist conspiracy,1
I'm not sure if I call myself a Zionist because it's such a tricky thing,1
"I have no honor of being on the stage with Zionist, Especially with somebody in a child killer.",1
"you know as Muslims and Arabs always the terrorists, the bad guys.",1
"it has uh to be aggressive terrorist Palestinian obviously, which it is currently being.",1
some Palestinians don't recognize the fact that um Israel already exists,1
I often have the feeling that um the very existence of the State of Israel is questions and and and that people don't really accept it.,1
"when they see any Palestinian, they think you are Hamas and you are out to kill us and that's why we need to destroy you.",1
"if you're holding in this room and you're you're you're listening to the voices, we're all trying to kill it.",1
one dead jew plus another dead jew equals how many dead Jews.,1
jews don't have a right to go and live in judea and samaria. That is all settlements and under international broke.,1
there should be no jews living in the future Palestinian state,1
Muslims cannot live in an Israeli state.,1
jews and Israelis shut their ears and lose all the value in your testimony that is so powerful,1
Muslims don't have a right to live in Israel,1
oh after 400 years of having slaves and all this and all the things that I don't even want to compare Palestinian because the slave struggle was way worse.,1
they're teaching Children to to haven to kill Palestinians,1
I think you're right that um Palestinians being conflated with terrorists are being completed with terrorists.,1
"jews do not go to the Temple Mount, the only jews that you will see on the Temple Mount will be an extremist",1
Iran does not want peace. Iran still occupying all those countries Iran to still sponsoring terrorism isn't it?,1
a jew is not allowed to go to the Temple Mount because it's such a holy places where the Holy of Holies,1
Israel will disappear one day and any boycotting of Israel just in flames this thought,1
"I don't hate jews to come personally, um I just hate their country.",1
jews can kill and make a lot of vandal in uh doing and then he uh called himself as saving himself,1
I cannot cannot unacceptable to see the jews kill us.,1
so many people that came not understanding anything about what it means to be jewish.,1
we lied to accept that Israel is uh estate is existing,1
we have been inter created a subconsciously programmed in order to have this kind of hate for the Jews.,1
Most jews in Israel are much darker than you and me.,1
"Well we don't want to kill the jews, we just want to kill the Zionist.",1
we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine.,1
"No Palestinian rational Palestinian, not a sellout. Palestinian would ever accept a Jewish state in Palestine.",1
Jews aren't indigenous,1
"jews are not a people, the UN's principle of the right to self determination applies only to colonize people who want to acquire their rights.",1
we talk about refusing a jewish state,1
"it's difficult like when I worked in here for for example, only I heard Arabic in the street, so I cannot understand, it's a bit uh stressful but it's not, I mean it's just like uh yeah it's normal, it's a bit, it's just a little bit strange because I don't understand but like a yeah, I mean once different doesn't mean the audio doesn't suffer.",1
"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. That that will be that is a threat.",1
"I think it's a bit difficult for for for for for Israeli Israeli mentality, because I I think the first Israelis, they wanted to get rid of the mentality of the diaspora IQ mentality, right?",1
Israeli mentality is a lot of times they erased all the past and it raised the memory.,1
"let's target all Israeli products, all Israeli institutions.",1
"we've heard is that the founder is essentially, you know, being essentially in is being accused of being anti Semitic, um dismissing fuck Israel.",1
"I 100% believe that there are lots of Palestinians who probably believe that, but there are also people who come in here and say fuck Israel.",1
there should be no Jewish state.,1
"Arabs have lower, lower I. Q. S. Than Jews.",1
This animalistic behavior jews in Israel should be protesting in their own country.,1
"What I first heard as a child was that Arabs were thieves. Arabs were dirty. Arabs which fight you no matter what, although jews were called thieves all the time too.",1
"Arab Israelis, which are really Palestinians are treated like shit, and that's just in Israel",1
